# roam-timeline

Generate timelines from [Roam](https://roamresearch.com) graphs. 

Different graphs are possible; currently the default is a stacked bar chart, each bar is a day, stacks are counts of common tags.

Status: crude but working. Here's an example from my first two weeks of using Roam


## Usage

Export a graph from Roam in JSON  format, then do:

    $ lein run <zipfile>

Graph will pop up in your default web browser. 

If you omit the zipfile argument, it will default to using the latest Roam export in `~/Downloads`.

Example:
